ðŸš€ Project Portfolio â€“ Yash Thakker

Welcome to my project portfolio! Below is a showcase of engineering and software projects Iâ€™ve built, ranging from embedded systems and IoT devices to robotics and mobile applications.


ðŸŽ® FPGA Platformer Game

Description:
A 2D platformer game implemented entirely in hardware on the Xilinx Urbana board. Designed custom game logic, rendering, and input handling directly in Verilog.

Key Features:

Built multiple levels with progression system.

Implemented game mechanics: jumping, collisions, hazards, and victory detection.

Lava blocks reset the playerâ€™s position; reaching the green flag advances to the next level.

Designed HDMI/VGA output module for real-time graphics rendering.

Integrated user input for responsive controls.

Tech Stack: Verilog, Xilinx Urbana FPGA board, HDMI/VGA output.
